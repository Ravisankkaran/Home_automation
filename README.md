# Home Automation using IoT Cloud and NodeMCU



This project enables you to control your home appliances remotely using an IoT cloud platform and NodeMCU. By connecting your devices to the internet, you can monitor and control them from anywhere in the world using a mobile app or a web interface. This repository contains the necessary code and instructions to set up your own home automation system.

## Features

- Control home appliances remotely
- Monitor the status of appliances in real-time
- Set schedules for automatic operations
- Receive notifications and alerts
- Energy consumption tracking
- User-friendly mobile app and web interface

## Hardware Requirements

- NodeMCU (ESP8266) board
- Relays to control the appliances
- Sensors (optional) for environment monitoring
- Power supply for NodeMCU and relays
- Internet connectivity

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- IoT cloud platform account (e.g., AWS IoT, Google Cloud IoT, or similar)
- Mobile app or web interface for remote access (platform-specific)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

```bash
[git clone https://github.com/your-username/home-automation.git](https://github.com/Ravisankkaran/Home_automation.git)
```

2. Open the Arduino IDE and install the ESP8266 board support by following the instructions provided by the board manufacturer.

3. Connect the NodeMCU board to your computer using a USB cable.

4. Open the `home-automation.ino` file in the Arduino IDE from the downloaded repository.

5. Configure the required settings in the code, such as your Wi-Fi credentials, IoT cloud platform details, and pin configurations for relays and sensors.

6. Install any necessary libraries by going to "Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Manage Libraries" and search for the library name.

7. Compile and upload the code to your NodeMCU board.

8. Set up the IoT cloud platform by creating the required devices, topics, and rules as per the platform's documentation.

9. Install the mobile app or set up the web interface provided by the IoT cloud platform to control and monitor your devices remotely.

10. Connect the NodeMCU board to the relays and appliances following the wiring diagram provided in the repository.

11. Power on the system and connect it to your Wi-Fi network.

12. Access the mobile app or web interface to start controlling your home appliances remotely.

## Usage

1. Launch the mobile app or access the web interface.

2. Log in using your credentials.

3. From the dashboard, you can view the status of your connected appliances.

4. Use the controls provided to turn on/off or schedule operations for specific appliances.

5. Set up notifications or alerts based on specific events or conditions.

6. Monitor energy consumption and analyze usage patterns if supported by the IoT cloud platform.
